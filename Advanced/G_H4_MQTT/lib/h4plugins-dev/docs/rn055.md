# Release Notes v0.5.5

## Introduction

This is a bugfix to 0.5.4 which is a **major** release, there have been significant changes since 0.4.0 so it is important to read [v0.5.4 Release Notes](rn051.md) in its entirety if you are familiar with previous versions

# Summary

**BUGS FIXED**

* UPNP devices not appearing / not discoverable by Alexa: new ucom.txt file in SPIFFS - re-upload SPIFFS
* Exception using certain functions in onMQTTConnect / Disconnect: Caused by event functions being called in sys context and not from queue, [H4P_AsyncMQTT](h4mqtt.md) updated to put onConnect/Disconnect in queue
* [H4P_Timekeeper](h4tk.md): would cause repeated random timeouts in MQTT connection.
* [H4P_Timekeeper](h4tk.md): would only allow +ve timezones.
* Name precedence was not not working correctly in H4P_Wifi / H4P_UPNPServer

**Known Issues**

[H4P_Timekeeper](h4tk.md)

"Note that there's a fairly well known memory leak in setenv() which means that if you change timezones repeatedly, which you might do for an application that handles multiple time zones, you'll eventually run out of memory. "
