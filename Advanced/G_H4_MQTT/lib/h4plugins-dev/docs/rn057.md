# Release Notes v0.5.7

## Introduction

A quick n dirty fix to incorporate the all-new [AsyncMQTT](http://github.com/philbowles/asyncmqtt) library which has been written from the ground up to replace the previous 3rd-party MQTT library which turned out to be **truly *awful***. - My fault for not evaluating it throroughly.

First thing then is to download/install the alpha version of [AsyncMQTT](http://github.com/philbowles/asyncmqtt) (just follow the link). It has no TLS and has not yet been tested on ESP32, other than that - even in alpha - it seems to be far more stable than "the other library"

Second minor change is the additon of two MDNS tags to enable the **fantastic** Windows Installer written by Adam Sharp ( [http://threeorbs.co.uk](http://threeorbs.co.uk) ) to not only download & install all the necessary libraries for you, but automatically install the Windows integration of UPnP features so you will be able to control your devices from the desktop "out-of-the-box". That will be coming soon in the next major release 0.6.0
