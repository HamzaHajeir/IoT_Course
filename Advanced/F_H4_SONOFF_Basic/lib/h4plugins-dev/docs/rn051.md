## NTP sync and clock time functions

Sync time with user-defined remote NTP servers. This allows some useful new features, such as:

* "Single-shot" user function at given time e.g. `h4tk.at("13:45",myFunction)`
* "Single-shot" H4P_BinarySwitch/Thing ON/OFF time e.g. `h4tk.atSource("13:45",ON)` see [Switches vs Things](things.md)
* Daily user function at given time e.g. `h4tk.daily("13:45",myFunction)`
* Daily H4P_BinarySwitch/Thing ON/OFF time e.g. `h4tk.dailySource("13:45",ON)` see [Switches vs Things](things.md)
* Schedule a list of times for user function with `h4tk.setSchedule(...)`
* Schedule a list of ON/OFF times for H4P_BinarySwitch/Thing with `h4tk.setScheduleSource(...)` see [Switches vs Things](things.md)

[Read the Docs](h4tk.md)

## Remote update

Pull updated binary / spiffs from remote server, and reboot with latest version. Nodejs/Express [example update server](../examples/LOGGING/H4P_HttpMySQLLogger/mysqlrest/routes/index.js) provided. 

[Read the Docs](h4ru.md)

---

## Presence detection
  
The ability to react to devices joining or leaving the network. This is useful for example to switch on outisde lights as you approach your home and your mobile phone comes into range of your WiFi router.

Methods are provided for detection of

* IP addresses
* MDNS service/protocol (ESP8266 only: ESP32 planned)
* H4 devices
* UPNP USN identifiers

Each of these has a version that links directly ([as a "Source"](#things-and-switches-input-connectors-are-now-%22sources%22)) to a [H4P_BinarySwitch / H4P_BinaryThing](things.md)

In the pipeline: ESP32 Bluetooth detection

[Read the Docs](h4pd.md)

---

## Web page / onof integration

If your sketch uses either a [H4P_BinarySwitch / H4P_BinaryThing](things.md), the "home" screen of the device will now contain a dynamic on/off slider button to activate the device. Any other remote action setting the device (e.g. Alexa Voice control) ON causes the display to update automatically: it will therefore always reflect the current state of the device.

## Web Console

The home page now contains a web console allwoing you to issue commands without HTTP REST, MQTT or Serial connection

**WARNING**

*The `h4/show/all` command will cause a crash in low-heap situations - avoid it if possible, use the individual `show` commands instead.*

---

## Master / slave linkage

H4 devices can be commanded to link to other devices such that turning on the master will automatically turn on all slaves.

The new command is `h4/slave/< name of H4 slave device >` with a payload of 1 to add (link to) the slave, zero to remove (unlink) the slave.

---

## Diagnostic Plugins

* [H4P_HeapWarn](h4hw.md) - which calls a user function on low heap ( < user value )
* [H4P_LoopCount](h4lc.md) - displays NLoops per user-chosen period (default 1sec) useful for identifying bottlenecks

---

## Example sketches

* [Remote configurator for generic sketches](../examples/XTRAS/ChezToiioT_Config/ChezToiioT_Config.ino)
* [Generic SONOFF sketch](../examples/XTRAS/Generic_SONOFF/Generic_SONOFF.ino)
* [Generic ESP01S sketch](../examples/XTRAS/Generic_ESP01S/Generic_ESP01S.ino)
* [Presence detection - H4 Device](../examples/PRESENCE/H4P_PresenceDetectH4/H4P_PresenceDetectH4.ino)
* [Presence detection - IP](../examples/PRESENCE/H4P_PresenceDetectIP/H4P_PresenceDetectIP.ino)
* [Presence detection - MDNS service/protocol](../examples/PRESENCE/H4P_PresenceDetectMDNS/H4P_PresenceDetectMDNS.ino)
* [Presence detection - UPNP USN identifier](../examples/PRESENCE/H4P_PresenceDetectUPNP/H4P_PresenceDetectUPNP.ino)

* [Low Heap Warning](../examples/DIAAGNOSTICS/H4P_HeapWarn/H4P_HeapWarn.ino)
* [Loop Counter](../examples/DIAGNOSTICS/H4P_LoopCount/H4P_LoopCount.ino)
* [Time Functions](../examples/TIME/H4P_Timekeeper/H4P_Timekeeper.ino)

---

## Commands

* `h4/host2/D,U` configures host device name D *and* upnp friendly name U in one command
* `h4/show/heap` a useful diagnostic feature
* `h4/slave/S` (S = another H4 device)
* `h4/wifi/apmode` force device into AP mode

The `host2` is useful when using a ["generic" sketch](advanced.md) to be loaded into multiple devices without hvaing to recompile individually for each device. The device host name and UPNP friendly name are not provided in the sketch, but sent via e.g. MQTT retained messages on startup.

Since the `host` and `upnp` comand each cause a reboot, using a single `host2` to do both means the dvice onlyreboots once after it ha been remotely configured.

Two new example sketches are provided in the `examples/XTRAS` folder showing how this is easily achieved.

---

## Functions

* `h4ce.getTaskType` translates numeric task types into human-readable form
* `h4ce.getTaskName` translates numeric task names into human-readable form

# Changed

## AsyncWebServer Authenticaton removed

[H4P_AsyncWebServer](h4asws.md) no longer provides admin username/password, hence they are removed from its constructor. 

It's a long story, and not a happy one.

## Mandatory starting requirements

The standard opening of any H4 sketch has changed considerably. First the mandatory call to H4 has been moved into `H4_USE_PLUGINS` so it is no longer required. Also, a decision was made to incorporate [H4P_SerialCmd](h4cmd.md) into *all* sketches automatically, so this has also been moved into `H4_USE_PLUGINS` which now performs all mandatory sketch initialisation in a single line.

This means that the parameters to H4 *and* H4P_SerialCmd are now passed instead to `H4_USE_PLUGINS`. A typical sketch now starts:

```cpp
#include<H4Plugins.h>
H4_USE_PLUGINS(115200,20,false) // Serial baud rate, Q size, SerialCmd autostop
```

The parameters are:

* Serial baud rate. If No Serial output is required, use 0
* Queue size. There is little reason to change this from the default value of 20, and only expert users should change this.
* New is the "`autoStop`" feature of H4P_SerialCmd

Stopping the `scmd` service improves performance by up to 50% (400% on STM32-NUCLEO!) so should be considered for all production code. The downside is that you are no longer able to issue Serial console commands. This can be reversed by remote restart of the scmd service (e.g. MQTT, HTTP REST, the new Web Console).

The default is false for development and testing, i.e do NOT auto-stop the `scmd` service (and therefore *do* allow Serial console commands) at the expense of overall performance.

Finally, the "handle" to the SerialCmd service has been changed from `h4sc` to `h4cmd` bit its service name remains the same at `scmd`

---

## *All* Plugins as services

Previously, some plugins such as WiFi and MQTT ran as "services" meaning they could be started and stopped and otherwise controlled in a standard manner. This has been extended to *all* plugins so that there is now a standard interface for everything and far fewer individual commands.

This means you *must* read the section on [command handling](h4cmd.md) before digging deeper into v0.5.4

---

## Things and switches input connectors are now "Sources"

The naming of the input connectors to drive Things or switches was confusing and they have now been changed to end in "Source". Any plugin ending this way will automatically link to either an `H4P_BinarySwitch` or `H4P_BinaryThing`. Also, the final parameter of all the GPIO-linked calls has been removed, as they each connect automatically to the default output device which must remain as `h4onof`.

Additionally, there is now an "autoOff" parameter on both `H4P_BinarySwitch` and `H4P_BinaryThing` meaning that they will turn themselves off after a given amount of time, irrespective of which source commanded them on. If left at the default valueof 0 they will stay one until commanded off.

The UPNP variants of Switch and Thing have been removed and replaced by a single `H4P_UPNPServer` which acts as a source in the same way as the GPIO input connectors.

In summary, a sketch may now have only a `H4P_BinarySwitch` **OR** a `H4P_BinaryThing` as its default action. This can be driven by any of the following input sources:

* GPIO-Related:

    * AnalogThresholdSource
    * DebouncedSource
    * EncoderSource
    * LatchingSource
    * PolledSource
    * RawSource
    * RetriggeringSource
    * MultiFunctionButton
  
* Time-related
    * atSource
    * dailySource

* Network-related

    * MQTT commands on/off/toggle/switch
    * HTTP REST requests on/off/toggle/switch
    * Web console
    * Presence detection of:
        * IP Address
        * H4 Device
        * UPNP USN identifier
        * MDNS service/protocol

* Serial console commands
* Physical button/switch

## AP Mode

A decision was taken to remove any automatic start into AP Mode, as used to happen after a factory reset.

The rationale is that H4/Plugins is a programming framework, not a "drop-in" replacement, so you will always be starting from the point of compiling your ssid and password into your code.

There is still the ability to force AP mode (for whatever reason) using the [H4P_MultifunctionButton](h4mfnb.md). This was previously the H4P_ThreeFunctionButton and would initiate a factory reset after beinf held for more than 5 seconds.

The [H4P_MultifunctionButton](h4mfnb.md) is now a *four*-function button. If held for more than 10 seconds it will force a reboot into AP mode. You can acheive the same effect with the new command `h4/wifi/apmode`.


If you get stuck you can revert your device to STA mode with  the `h4/wifi/change/newssid,newpassword` command to change the ssid "on the fly".

Given these options, it was felt that there was no strong reason for ever booting into AP mode automatically.

---

## Renamed commands

* `h4/mqtt/change` (change MQTT server:port) is now `h4/mqtt`

* `h4/upnp/name` (change UPNP device friendly name) is now `h4/upnp`

---

## MQTT library changed

H4/Plugins now use the [MQTT Async Client library](https://github.com/marvinroger/async-mqtt-client) in place of `PubSubClient`. You must donwload and install the Async lib before compiling any v0.5.4 programs

---

# REMOVED

## Unloading

All refernces, functions, commands related to unloading plugins have been removed, as the same functionality is now provided by the `h4/svc/stop/xxxx` [command](h4cmd.md)

## Trusted names

All refernces, functions, commands related to "trusted names" have been removed, as the same functionality is now provided by service names an the human-readable values for these is now available in the [new functions](#functions) `h4ce.getTaskType` and `h4ce.getTaskName`
