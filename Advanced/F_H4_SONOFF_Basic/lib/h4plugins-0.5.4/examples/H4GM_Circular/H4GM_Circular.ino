    ALL GPIO strategies are derived from H4GPIOPin: the following members are available
    inside ALL GPIO pin callbacks, once you have a valid pointer for the pin type using 
    H4GM_PIN( type ) with specific underlying type Raw needs H4GM_PIN(Raw);

    uint8_t         pin=0;                  // GPIO hardware pin number
    uint8_t         gpioType=0;             // INPUT, INPUT_PULLUP, OUTPUT etc
    H4GM_STYLE      style;                  // Strategy: Raw, debounced, retriggering etc
    uint8_t         sense=0;                // active HIGH or LOW
    unsigned long   Tevt=0;                 // uS time of last event
    int             state=0;                // 32 wide as it holds analog value as well as digital 0/1
                                            // and not uint because encoder returns -1 or +1
    uint32_t        delta=0;                // uS since last change
    uint32_t        rate=0;                 // instantaenous rate cps
    uint32_t        Rpeak=0;                // peak rate   
    uint32_t        cps=0;                  // sigma changes/sec (used internally, frequently re-set)
    uint32_t        cMax=UINT_MAX;          // max permitted cps (see "throttling");
    uint32_t        nEvents=UINT_MAX;       // sigma "Events" (meaning depends on inheriting strategy)
            
    Additional members for Circular:

        uint32_t    stage // current stage of cycle
        
        A Circular GPIO increments the extra variable 'stage' every time it is pressed and released.
        When 'stage' reaches a given value, it "wraps around" back to 1. So if nStages is 3 then
        'stage' will be: 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2...etc for repeated presses. For a GPIO that does not wrap around,
        see "Sequenced"

        It is derived form the Debounced strategy, so it only changes state on a "clean"
        transition. For this reason it also requires a switch-dependent value for dbTimeMs

        NOTE: you will get a "fake" event at startup with stage=0
