# Logging / Loggers

## Adds event logging to multiple destinations for H4 Universal Scheduler/Timer + Plugins.

*All plugins depend upon the presence of the [H4 library](https://github.com/philbowles/H4), which must be installed first.*

---

# What do they do?

H4Plugins loggers can send messages to a variety of destinations, depending on which logger you choose. There are currently 

* H4P_HttpMySQLLogger which sends logged events to a remote Webserver for storage in a MySQL database
  **N.B. H4P_HttpMySQLLogger is experimental and has [its own documentation page](h4mysql.md)**

* H4P_MQTTLogger sends log messages to MQTT Server
* H4P_MQTTHeapLogger a specialised H4P_MQTTLogger which periodically logs value of FreeHeap to MQTT
* H4P_MQTTQueueLogger a specialised H4P_MQTTLogger which periodically logs size of queue to MQTT
* H4P_SerialLogger which does exactly what it says on the tin

Writing your own logger is seriously easy (see below)

The important thing to note is that each logger is called in turn, thus you can log to several destinations at a time for a single message. The serial logger is a useful diagnostic aid, as it shows what is getting logged to other - less visible - destinations, e.g. remote servers.

Also note that the main interface `h4cmd.logEventType(H4P_LOG_TYPE,const string& src,const string& tgt,const string& fmt,...)` (which operates like `printf` with variable number of parameters) will simply do nothing if no loggers are installed. This allows it to be left in the code and "switched on or off" by commenting out the loggers, which can be flipped back in at a stroke for testing.

Better still. there is a macro `h4UserEvent("printf-style %s",...)` which simply calls `h4cmd.logEventType` "under the hood" but can be "compiled out" by removing the `#define H4P_LOG_EVENTS` entry in `config.h`, which reduces the size of the binary. Unless you have good reason (which will be rare) then you should always use `h4UserEvent`.

Finally, most loggers have  `filter` parameter which allows the logger to operate on only certain event types:

```cpp
enum H4P_LOG_TYPE {
    H4P_LOG_H4=1,
    H4P_LOG_SVC_UP=2,
    H4P_LOG_SVC_DOWN=4,
    H4P_LOG_CMD=8,
    H4P_LOG_USER=16,
    H4P_LOG_MQTT_HEAP=64,
    H4P_LOG_MQTT_Q=128,
    H4P_LOG_PD_ENTER=256,
    H4P_LOG_PD_LEAVE=512,
    H4P_LOG_ALL=0xffffffff,
    H4P_LOG_ERROR=H4P_LOG_ALL
};
```

The values are chosen such that logical operations can be use , e.g. `H4P_LOG_SVC_UP | H4P_LOG_SVC_DOWN` will react only to those two service events. Another example is `H4P_LOG_ALL & ~H4P_LOG_SVC_UP &~ H4P_LOG_SVC_DOWN` which will *exclude* service events. The default filter is `H4P_LOG_ALL`;

---

# What information gets logged?

The logging interface send the following data items to each logger:

* Msg: the content of the message
  
* Event type (see above)

* Source: Origin of the event

For `H4P_LOG_SVC_UP` and `H4P_LOG_SVC_DOWN` this will be "H4"
For `H4P_LOG_CMD` it is the sub-system that initiated the cmd
    * "serl" when issued from the serial console
    * "mqtt" in response to a subscribed topic
    * "asws" if it came from the AsyncWebServer HTTP REST interface
    * "upnp" when from a UPNP device e.g. Amazon Alexa
    * "user" when called directly from user code

* Target: will usually be empty or "H4" when sent by anything other than MQTT. For subscribed topics, it will be the prefix of the MQTT publish as described in [H4P_AsyncMQTT](h4mqtt.md). In summary, one of:
  * all
  * < your board type > e.g. "WEMOS_D1MINI"
  * < the device chip ID > e.g. "17D858"
  * < your device name > e.g. "myIOTdevice"

# Loggers

Most loggers implement `h4/xxxx/msg/any old message` to put any message you choose into the log

# H4P_SerialLogger (name "slog")

## Usage

```cpp
#include<H4Plugins.h>
H4_USE_PLUGINS(115200,20,false) // Serial baud rate, Q size, SerialCmd autostop
H4P_SerialLogger h4sl(...
```

## Prequisites

none

## Additional Commands

none

---

## API

Constructor takes `uint32_t` filter parameter that defaults to `H4P_LOG_ALL`.

# H4P_LocalLogger (name "log") [ ESP8266 / ESP32 only ]

H4P_LocalLogger reserves a user-defind amount of free SPIFFS space to create a log file. When that amount has been exceeded, it will `flush` the log, i.e. it will print the contents to the serial monitor and empty the file.

**WARNING** *Choose a small value for the log file size - if the value is close to the amount of free heap (about 30k) then the MCU will crash when it tries to flush the file, as it will need more than the available RAM to read the file. This is a short-term debugging aid, **NOT** a long-term archival solution. For the latter, you need to send the log messages "offsite" to e.g. a remote server with MQTT or HTTP.*

## Usage

```cpp
#include<H4Plugins.h>
H4_USE_PLUGINS(115200,20,false) // Serial baud rate, Q size, SerialCmd autostop
H4P_LocalLogger h4ll;
```

## Prequisistes

Board must be compiled with an option to reserve an amount of SPIFFS

## Additional Commands

* h4/log/clear
* h4/log/flush

# Advanced topics

## Writing your own logger

Let's assume you want a logger that prints the milliseconds uptime of the MCU before each message

The code would look like this:

```cpp

#include <H4PCommon.h>

class myLogger: public H4PLogService {
        void _logEvent(const string &msg,H4P_LOG_TYPE type,const string& source,const string& target,uint32_t error){
            Serial.print("myLogger ");
            Serial.print(millis());
            Serial.print(" ");
            Serial.println(msg.c_str()); // or  Serial.println(CSTR(msg));
        }
    public:
        myLogger(): H4PLogService("mylog"){}
};

```

...and that's it! Then add the new logger to your sketch - Everything else is automatic.
